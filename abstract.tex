   Proposal summary (identical to the abstract from the online proposal
   submission forms, section 1).

   ~\\
   The abstract (summary) should, at a glance, provide the reader with
   a clear understanding of the objectives of the research proposal
   and how they will be achieved. The abstract will be used as the
   short description of your research proposal in the evaluation
   process and in communications to contact in particular potential
   independent external experts and/or to inform the Commission and/or
   the programme management committees and/or relevant national
   funding agencies (provided you give permission to do so where
   requested in the online proposal submission forms, section 1). It
   must therefore be short and precise and should not contain
   confidential information.

   ~\\
   Please use plain typed text, avoiding formulae and other special
   characters. The abstract must be written in English. There is a
   limit of 2000 characters (spaces and line breaks included).
